# TalkTimer

TalkTimer is a simple WinUI 3 desktop application designed to help users become more aware of how long they are talking. It features a timer that starts counting when the user's input device (e.g., microphone) is unmuted and resets when the input device is muted again. This visual feedback encourages users to be more mindful of their speaking time and promotes better communication during meetings, presentations, or other situations where time management is essential.

## Features

- Timer display that counts elapsed seconds while the input device is unmuted
- Background color changes to yellow after 15 seconds and red after 30 seconds to indicate the duration of speaking time
- Slider to adjust the input device's volume
- Dropdown menu to select the active input device from a list of available devices

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later
- Visual Studio with the .NET SDK for WinUI 3
